This directory contains the additional data for updated stellar information that can help to distinguish between real planets and astrophysical or instrumental False positives.

- `Berger2018_tbl1.txt` comes from *Revised Radii of Kepler Stars and Planets Using Gaia Data Release 2* https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00231
- `Dattilo2019tbl3.txt` comes from *Identifying Exoplanets with Deep Learning II: Two New Super-Earths Uncovered by a Neural Network in K2 Data* https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10507

The test train val directories contain the revised stellar info data, match to the format of the preprocessed numpy binaries from [Frontier Development Lab Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/sxj7r30thd66nij/AACptMysLyaMhXe817e4z7Sya?dl=0).
